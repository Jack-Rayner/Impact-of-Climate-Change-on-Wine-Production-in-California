### Introduction

Due to a variety of geographic and meteorological factors, the State of California has serious exposure to climate change. In particular, California’s agricultural industry has substantial amounts of risk to drought and extreme weather events. This should be of particular concern for policy makers as California is the largest agricultural producer and exporter in the United States, with roughly $49.1 billion of revenue being generated in [2020](https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/Statistics/).

At the economic and cultural heart of California’s agricultural industry is the production and sale of wine. According to the [Wine Institute](https://wineinstitute.org/press-releases/california-wine-sales-hit-40-billion-in-2020-despite-pandemic/), despite pandemic California wineries 'experienced an increase in sales by volume in 2020, totaling an estimated retail value of 40$ billion'. However, there are multiple studies that shows how climate natural variability and change are both threatening wine quality and production. For instance, a study released in 2011 from Cornell University('Climate change associated effects on grape and wine quality and production') shows how under extreme hot temperatures , already experienced in different regions, 'vine metabolism may be inhibited leading to reduced metabolite accumulations which may affect wine aroma and color.'(add other example of impacts). Other potential impacts include: increase number of grape diseases and other pests due to temperature rise (Nemail et al. 2001); fewer cool nights could impact grape quality (Elkjer 2008) and more extreme hot days (temperature above 35C) decrease grape productivity (Diffenbaugh 2006)

According to Standford Univerisity Study (Jonathan Gatto et al. March 2009), the elements of climate that are most important for wine growth are 'temperature, variability of day and night temperatures, the difference between winter and summer temperatures, sunlight, rainfall, humidity and wind. In fact specific grape varieties can only growth within limited temperature ranges: for instance, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir both need an average growing season (April-October) temperature of 15-17C. Cabernet Sauvignon and Sangiovese need sligtlhy  higher temperatures 17-19C. In fact grapes can be labeled as either cool and warm varieties and are constrained by the climate of their growing regions.

The same study reports that temperature and precipitation variability are the most important climate factors that will affect grapes and wine price, quality and quantity in the future. In the same study, the authors have interviewed representatives of the wine industry indicating that i) in the short term water supply will be the most pressing challenge. It is important to notice that the water footprint of wine is  substantial. According to a study by the Global Footprint Network, the average water footprint of a bottle of wine is 632 litters. ii) In the long term, temperature variability will be the greatest concern.  The intervwied farmers reported that in the recent years  higher temperatures have forced growers to pick grapes sooner when sugar levels are too high; and this causes a higher alcohol content in wines which negatively affects taste and quality.

Another component with implications for both California and climate change is that roughly 70% of laborers are immigrants who are in the United States illegally from countries south of the border who are also greatly threatened by climate change. All of these factors pose a serious threat to both the quality, price, and yield of wine in California, highlighting the importance of a comprehensive adaptation strategy for the industry.

### Problem Statement  

[The Wine Institute](https://wineinstitute.org/about-us/) - which represents about 1000 wineries and affiliated businesses and it is the 'only US organization advocating for wine at the state, federal and international levels' - wanted to have  a better picture of the potential impact of climate natural variability and change on wine production in the State of California. More specifically, they wanted to understand whether by an increase of the average temperature as well as to a reduction of precipitation could correspond a substantial drop in wine production. Because of their economical value, the Institute was particularly interested in the following counties: Napa, Sonoma and San Joaquin. Serving as members of the Wine Institute Data Science Team, we embraced the challenge by developing a multiple linear regression models that could predict wine productions under two different forward-looking emissions scenarios: i) RCP 4.5 or intermediate scenario ; ii) RCP 8.5 or hot house world. Because within the RCP 4.5 the average temperature and water availability would be respectively lower and higher than the one that Californian would experience in a RCP 8.5 world, the hypothesis is that - by maintaining everything else constant - we would expect a much lower yield in a hot house world.
